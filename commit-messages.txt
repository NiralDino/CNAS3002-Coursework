    I've added an if loop on the standard deviation calculation so that the user is reminded to add more numbers if they've just inputted 1 number on their list, I've also added a welcome print statement and print statements to say which answer is for which calculation.

    I've added user input where the user will give a set of numbers separated by a space, then it'll be saved for the calculations that are done later, as well as that there's a try/except error handling block where if the user enters a letter the application will show a message instead of crashing with the ValueError
